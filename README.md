This Repository is from the ROV Submersible Project by Peyton Conrady

The contents of this repository are iterated versions of a program to control a submersible ROV that will have a claw and live video feed for the purpose of locating and
retrieving disc golf discs from the bottom of ponds and small lakes.

This ROV operates using a GoPro Hero 9 Black camera to live stream footage to your device from the submersible. The camera has a coaxial cable attached to it that runs with an umbylical tether into a spool controlled by a motor possitioned on a raft that the ROV tugs along. On the raft is the antenna for the camera, an HM-10 blutooth chip, a motor operated spool to control tether length and depth of the sub, and lipo batter to power the motor. The HM-10 chip connects with your phone to recieve commands from a compatible bluetooth terminal app.

Bluetooth communincations are transmitted through the tether to the submarine, controlling an arduino uno housed within the body. Depending on user input, the Arduino Uno can control a servo operated claw mounted to the front of the sub, two thrusters mounted on either side of the sub, or the motor that reels the tether spool.

The Raft is made of 2x4 pine wood. The Submarine body and claw system is 3d printed out of PLA plastic. The body of the submarine is waterproofed with a layer of marine JB weld and Flex Seal. To change batteries and make repairs, there is a waterproof maintainence hatch on the rear of the sub. Currently, waterproofing is proving to be a key issue.
